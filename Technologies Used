## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Our team will use the pandas library to clean and transform our data and export that data into csv files. We will make sure all of the data types are accurate, drop null values, etc. Then we will create a schema/flow chart with the appropriate primary and secondary keys as well as their respective data types, and any connections that can be made between csv files will become apparent.

## Database Construction
We will import the clean csv files into SQL for easy querries and analysis. Aditional tables may be created with the SQL querry tool depending on what needs to be analyzed.

## Machine Learning
We'll be using SK Learn for our Machine Learning Library, as well as Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

## Dashboard
Currently, our Dashboard will be created through Tableau to create a fully functioning and interactive dashboard that's visually appealing for our presentation.
