**Selected Topic**

 - Hash rates, policies, government articles, definitions of stable vs. altcoins, bank/gov't adoptions 


**What we're looking to solve for**

 - Is crypto good to invest in? *expand on this, get more specific with how we would deem it good/bad etc. time frame*
 - Can we predict when a cryptocurrency may crash? *Can we look at articles about a cryptocurrency to predict an 5%* change in prices?*
 - Does an article's sentiment analysis on a given cryptocurrency directly affect trading volumes?
 - Are more eco-conscious coins going to outpace conventional coins
 - Stablecoins
