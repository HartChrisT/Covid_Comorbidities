# Covid_Comorbidities

**Pulling from multiple sources of data, this project aims to answer the question of:**
Do individuals with comorbidities die more from covid than those with no known health issues?

## Hypothesis
Main Hypothesis: Individuals with comorbidities die more from covid than those with no known health issues

Alternative Hypothesis: Individuals with comorbidities do not die more from covid than those with no known health issues

Null hypothesis: There isn't enough evidence to support individuals with comorbidities die more or less than those with no known health issues

## Technologies
A brief description of the technologies we're using: 
- SK Learn (Machine Learning Library)
- Pandas & J'upyter Notebook' - (Machine Learning/Database)
- SQL (Database)
- Postgres (Database)
- Tableau (Visualization)

X Role:
-  Which tools are the best fit for your project?
-  What will be used for each section? For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools.
-  How will the dashboard be built?
-  By the live session, submit a list of technologies you and your team intend to use for the project. Make sure to explain which technology is being used where (e.g., Pandas for data cleaning, Postgres for storage, etc.).
-  When you're comfortably working from your branch, create a document named "technology.md" and push it up to your branch. Submit a link to your branch to your instructor during the virtual class.

-  # Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SKLearn, Pandas & J'upyter Notebook are the ML technologies we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. 

## Dashboard
Tableau will be the primary technology used to create an interactive, visually appealing dashboard. The two main reasons Tabluea will be our primary Dashboard technology are Tableau has no row limit & Tableau allows us to avoid static dashboards. No row limit allows us to upload and analyze the millions of rows of data we've gathered, without overly-long processing times. Typically, dashboards are shared through PDF's, making them static from the moment they're sent; however, Tableau allows us to share our dashboards and will automatically update them with any changes.
