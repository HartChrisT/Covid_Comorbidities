# Covid
**Pulling from multiple sources of data, this project aims to answer the question of:

Do individuals with comorbidities die more from covid than those with no known health issues?

**Selected Topic**

Covid

**Why we chose this topic**

By using machine learning, we can identify which factors increase the likelihood of a 'covid' death and predict which target groups will have the highest death rate. 
After identifying the at-risk target groups, we can identify best practices and precautions for their safety.


**Data source details**

 - https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Conditions-Contributing-to-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Stat/hk9y-quqm

**What we're looking to solve for**

 - Do individuals with comorbidities die more from covid than those with no known health issues?

**Communication protocols**

 - The team has established a GitHub, with each team member owning a unique branch
 - Twice weekly zoom collaborations have been set up to track progress 
 - Team roles have been clearly defined so each team member knows what they are expected to contribute. For this week, 
	 - Triangle: Kristen
	 - Square: Jeff
	 - X: Giovanni
	 - Circle: Aung, Chris
 - A slack channel has been established to share links and other ideas that come up between working sessions
