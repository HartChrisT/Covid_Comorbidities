# Covid_Comorbidities

**Pulling from multiple sources of data, this project aims to answer the question of:
Do individuals with comorbidities die more from covid than those with no known health issues?

## Hypothesis
Main Hypothesis: Individuals with comorbidities die more from covid than those with no known health issues

Alternative Hypothesis: Individuals with comorbidities do not die more from covid than those with no known health issues

Null hypothesis: There isn't enough evidence to support individuals with comorbidities die more or less than those with no known health issues

## Technologies
A brief description of the technologies we're using: 
- SK Learn (Machine Learning Library)
- Pandas & J'upyter Notebook' - (Machine Learning/Database)
- SQL (Database)
- Postgres (Database)
- Tableau, (Visualization)

TO-DO List:
- Update ReadMe using Segment 1 Rubric ?'s
  - Break Into 5 segments: 
  - Presentation: Topic: Covid, Reasons why we selected this topic: Real-life application and relevance for 2+ years, Description of the data sources:?????, questions     we hope to answer: Do individuals with comorbidities die more from covid than those with no known health issues? If yes, which comorbidities are highest risk.
  - Github: 4+ commits for each member, each member has their own branch
  - Machine Learning Model: Model takes in data from the provisional database & outputs labels for input data
  - Database: Sample that mimics the expected final database structure of schema, Draft machine learnng module is connected to the provisional database.
  - Dashboard: N/A for S1

Before meeting with your instructor, your team will need to complete the following:
- Decide on a topic, source data, and perform exploratory data analysis.
- Create a repository and establish individual branches for each team member. (Done)
- Create a mockup of a machine learning model.
- Create a mockup of a database.
- Decide which technologies will be used. (Done)

Machine Learning Model:
Team members will be expected to present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
- Takes in data from the provisional database
- Outputs label for input data

Database Integration
Team members will be expected to present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database

Dashboard:
N/A

X Role:
-  Which tools are the best fit for your project?
-  What will be used for each section? For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools.
-  How will the dashboard be built?
-  By the live session, submit a list of technologies you and your team intend to use for the project. Make sure to explain which technology is being used where (e.g., Pandas for data cleaning, Postgres for storage, etc.).
-  When you're comfortably working from your branch, create a document named "technology.md" and push it up to your branch. Submit a link to your branch to your instructor during the virtual class.

-  # Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SKLearn, Pandas & J'upyter Notebook are the ML technologies we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. 

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on ___.
